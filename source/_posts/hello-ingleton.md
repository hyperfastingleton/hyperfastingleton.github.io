**Welcome to our new website!** 

This is the first post, which is not much more than a test. You can see from the archives on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/HyperfastIngleton) that we've had a web presence for well over a year, but until now, having our own website hasn't really been top of our priority list.

But.... this year the Ingleton B4RN project is really gaining momentum in the village, and it is time for the most ambitious B4RN community project of all time to have its own website!
