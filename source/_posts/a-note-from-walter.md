**A note from B4RN's 1,000,000th shareholder** 

Walter Wilcox (pictured being presented with B4RN's millionth share) sent us this kind note. Walter has been very supportive of the Ingleton project from the beginning. Thanks Walter!

A post from a VERY enthusiastic B4RN supporter (and rather miffed) southerner.

The first picture of a strange wrinkly (car park attendant) you see on the first video is me; feeling VERY cold in the “gentle breeze” at the inaugural dig above Quernmore in 2012. I am the first and millionth shareholder all the way from Surrey where I had a future-proof Grant-awarded project until it was destroyed.

I would like to emphasise the importance of the near-unique (for the UK) fully future proofed symmetric high-reliability design. Every cabinet will eventually have at least TWO fibre feeds capable of vast amounts of internet traffic well into the future. Multiple feeds are provided so that a cabinet can suffer a cable break without losing service to the majority of those connected to it.

Hyperfast 1,000 Mbps (Mega-bits per second) is actually far more than most houses can consume today unless you have a family of Victorian proportions or many visitors all using different web services.

Similarly most people can survive with different download speeds to your computers and TVs compared to slower upload speeds to the internet. However that’s beginning to change as many people are now storing their data on the internet using e.g. DropBox services. Multi-way video chats and conferencing facilities require similar down and up load speeds too. They are increasing in use as it saves a lot of remote meeting time and car travel too.

The really good news is that the B4RN network design is immediately capable of vast expansion at very little additional expense. Just as one example B4RN’s plans started with just eight Parishes connected to the internet in Manchester but has already “exploded” to over 50 and is shortly to have a second internet connection in Edinburgh. It follows that in the future any other parish along that main internet route can be added just as soon as the residents raise the cash and dig in their ducts.

The really REALLY good news is that everyone in any location** within a parish that has buried the ducts can and WILL be connected to this magnificent service at the bargain price of only £30.00 per month inc. VAT plus a connection fee for the equipment of just £150.00. Even the fee is waived for shareholders contributing £1,500.

** One of the longer services that has already been installed is over 3 km to Leck Fell Farm.

Many of you will know that the major Telcos have already announced increases in their charges this year. However, as B4RN is a Community Interest Company, all surplus MUST, by law, only benefit the community rather than the shareholders. In the future the shareholders will decide whether the surplus should be used to decrease the fees or whether to award money to other community projects.

Finally I have observed recently that some shops and services have closed down in the village but I have also observed that a stronger community spirit results from all the volunteers working together. Apart from the domestic benefits of a hyperfast broadband service (and increased house price value) more businesses and visitors will be attracted to the area. I very much hope you will see these regeneration opportunities blossom over the next few years.

Ingleton will be a special installation challenge due to its quite dense central area buildings and “mountainous scenery”. May I wish you all good fortune and Godspeed with your challenge that I’m convinced will be well on the way to completion this year.
