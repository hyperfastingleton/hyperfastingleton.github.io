## How much does it cost?

B4RN costs **£30 per month** on a rolling monthly contract. You need to bear in mind this is for a 1000Gb symmetric true fibre connection, and there is **no landline charge**.

There is also an initial £150 connection charge. Some people [choose to invest](/investing/) £1,500 in B4RN shares to gain a **free connection**, among other significant benefits. This is how we fund the Ingleton project.

The [full price list](https://b4rn.org.uk/b4rn-service/charges/) for businesses, schools etc. can be found on the B4RN website. 

## What about my telephone?
B4RN just provides your Internet service, and doesn't do anything else. 

Many people decide they do not need a landline since these days they can use their mobiles, and were only paying for their copper landline to get an Internet connection!

Do you really need your landline? If so, you can:

- keep your BT landline as well as B4RN and pay for that separately
- switch to an Internet telephony provider and **keep your existing  number**. You can sign up with [Vonage](https://www.vonage.co.uk/home/) or similar from around **£8 per month**. 

There are several things to consider when deciding whether to ditch your landline or use Internet telephony. Please see  [the B4RN website](https://b4rn.org.uk/faqs/) until we write a more detailed guide!

If you have a poor mobile signal in your house, the B4RN router supports Wifi Calling which (if your phone and carrier support it) routes your mobile signal through the Internet. This is great if you live in a stone cottage or barn conversion!

## What about my TV?
Most modern smart TVs can stream from the Internet, and B4RN provides one of the best connections in the world. A single B4RN connection can support everyone in the family watching different programmes on iPlayer at once, in HD! If you pay for an existing satellite or cable packages, you must decide for yourself what you want to do.
