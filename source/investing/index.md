## Investing in B4RN for the Ingleton area

People have lots of questions about investing in B4RN. This isn’t a charitable cause, and we do not need donations, but **we do need investment from people and businesses**. This is a community project and will happen if the community gets behind it. 

B4RN will use investor’s addresses to gauge the interest in a route. We can’t dig a route until we’ve got investment from enough properties along it!

There are **three essential questions** for anyone thinking about investing:

- Do I want to help bring hyperfast broadband to my home (or business)?
- Do I want to do something valuable for Ingleton?
- Can I tie up some money for at least three years in an investment?

If the answers are YES, the most popular way to invest is to buy shares. For example:

* Beatrice buys £1,500 of B4RN shares. When her property is connected, she gets her **£150 connection for free**. Since she is employed and earns over £15k annually, she claims back **£405 from HMRC** as one-off EIS tax-relief via her self-assessment tax return or adjusted tax code. From year 4 onwards, she receives **5% interest on her investment** as a payment of £75 / year, for as long as she holds the shares (this is subject to board approval and available funds).

We need to update the loan examples.*
