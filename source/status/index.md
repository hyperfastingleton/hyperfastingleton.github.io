Hyperfast Ingleton is the biggest B4RN project ever undertaken. There are five areas which will serve all the properties within the geographical reach of the Ingleton hub. We have active teams of volunteers planning and working on each of these areas:

Ingleton village
Thornton-in-Lonsdale
Chapel-le-Dale
Route 1 (from Parkfoot)
Cold Cotes and Bentham lines

Please ask us for our info pack on investing, and talk to your local champions about helping with digging.  You can say hello at hyperfast.ingleton@gmail.com for more information. Our Facebook page is www.facebook.com/HyperfastIngleton.
