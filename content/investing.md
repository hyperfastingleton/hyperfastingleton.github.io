Investing
=========

This isn’t a charitable cause, and we do not need donations, but **we do need investment pledges**. The figures sound large, but because this is a tax-efficient investment in something with big personal and economic benefits, other communities have had no problem raising the funds. 

The Ingleton funds will be ring-fenced
You can “earn” investment by digging (we will follow up with a later email about this)
We only need about £50k of investment pledges to start digging! 
The size of the turnout at the public meeting means that B4RN will happily support us even with a modest investment pledge, because they know that interest will continue to grow as digging starts and properties get connected. And, we’ve got the names of over 40 people possibly interested in investing already.

You may have noticed that Barry was not trying to "sell" us B4RN at the public meeting - he is clearly a man with an MBE and no need to do so. In fact, the 5% interest offered on the loans is currently under review by B4RN because of their runaway success - so we need to act quickly to get this rate.

Minimum shareholding £100 (maximum £100,000).
All shareholders are members of B4RN. One member one vote.
Shares must be held for a minimum of 3 years.
Individual investors can claim 30% tax relief (HMRC Enterprise Investment Scheme).
After year 3, interest of 5% can be paid out or reinvested.
Invest £1,500 and claim free connection worth £150.
Shares can only ever be sold back to B4RN at £1 each.

What now?
Please send us an email with your investment pledge. The Ingleton team will collate them and, when we have reached £50k, we can start digging as soon as the weather gets better and the ground dries up.
Lots of people couldn’t make it to the public meeting on Monday. Please talk to anyone who might be interested in investing. Forward this email to them or ask them to get in touch for more information.
Remember: You dig to B4RN. B4RN does not dig to you!
