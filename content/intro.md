Hyperfast Ingleton
------------------

Hyperfast Ingleton is a working group of locals who want to bring the amazing B4RN network to Ingleton. Yes, the whole parish, including Chapel-le-Dale.

The Internet was never meant to run on **old decaying telephone lines**. This is why any connection you can get in the much of the UK is **slow, unreliable and expensive**. 

B4RN offers optical fibre **light speed internet** from the inside of your property all the way to the international hub in Manchester. It is completely different to the so-called "broadband"  we've been fobbed-off with by monopoly telecom providers and the government for years.

For **£30 / month** you get a **1000Mb symmetric connection**. This is perhaps 100x better than you’re getting now, even if your house is near a green cabinet. For many rural properties, this could be 1000x better than your current connection.

For **homes** you can  

- ditch your **landline** contract (if you like)
- switch your **broadband** contract to B4RN
- ditch your satellite **television** contract (if you like) and switch to internet TV services

For **businesses and homeworkers** you get

- ultra-reliable, always-on, gigabit internet which will hugely benefit existing businesses and enable new businesses to locate in Ingleton

For everyone 

- we think that B4RN could be a **transformative infrastructure** that can benefit the whole Ingleton community, now and for the coming century.

This is why we’re so excited about it. We want our children and young people to be able to stay and live here, if they choose to. B4RN is already making new, local high-tech jobs a reality. 

The B4RN project is unique - there is really **nothing else quite like it in the world** - and now it’s on our doorstep. The Hyperfast Ingleton team has a plan, and after a false start and some bad luck with government vouchers, we are keen to move quickly!
 

More about B4RN
---------------

Broadband for the Rural North Ltd or ‘B4RN’ was launched in December 2011 by a local volunteer group led by industry expert **Barry Forde**. Registered as a community benefit society with the FSA (under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965) it can **never be bought** by a commercial operator and its **profits can only be distributed to the community**.

The first soil was cut in 2011 around Arkholme and Quernmoor, and the network has since expanded in all directions. As of January 2016, B4RN has

- over **1,500 connected customers**
- over **800km of core network** in Lancashire, N. Yorks and Cumbria
- ten staff and **hundreds of volunteers**
- about **65% of all properties** in the completed areas actively using the service
- been trusted with **£1.5m of share investment** and £1m in loans from local communities

In 2015 Barry Forde and Chris Conder, whom some of you may know, were included on the Queen’s Honours list and **awarded MBEs** in recognition of this unique achievement.

People have already **moved their homes and businesses** to where they can get a B4RN connection.
