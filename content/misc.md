Friends,

Thank you to everyone who came to the meeting on such a wet and windy Monday night. We reckon there must have been at least 120 people in the room, meaning Ingleton gets the official prize for the biggest community B4RN meeting ever!

Which shows there is a huge interest in making this happen for Ingleton!
